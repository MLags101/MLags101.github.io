							<p>As part of the SolidWorks unit in my ME 1670(Engineering Design) course I took in my second year, 
							we had a project to model a series of interlocking parts. I chose to design the Space Shuttle, where the 
							interlocking parts are the SRBs, the External Tank, and the Shuttle itself. The parts were printed on a Stratasys SLS printer.
							I found this project a great opportunity not only to apply the modeling techniques I had learned, but to also push myself 
							with a challenging and complex design. Additionally, because our designs were actually fabricated, a significant component
							of the project was to incorporate proper engineering tolerances for the interlocking features. I based my 3D model off drawings 
							I found on NASA's website and tried to keep things as proportional as I could, while also keeping a minimum feature thickness 
							requirement in mind. There were definitely times where the task felt almost insurmountable, but eventually my model came out looking 
							pretty good, and just as importantly, when it got printed, the parts just fit together.</p>
