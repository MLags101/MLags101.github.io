								As Drone Lead, I decided to overhaul our entire system, start from scratch and focus on maintaining comms since that was our point of failure last year. I rebuilt the frame using scrapped carbon fiber
								 components from a Tarot frame, and integrating them with a custom designed and 3D printed shell. To solve the issue of operating within the HAB, I designed and built a tracking antenna that used an Intel 
								 Nuc to receive telemtery and video and relay it into the ground station. For the telemtery, I used a pair of RFD900x radios. For high quality aerial video, I decided to switch away from an analog setup and 
								 instead used OpenHD for digital transmission. The OpenHD setup used a Raspberry Pi 4, an Arducam camera, and an ASUS AC56 wifi adapter which I powered directly from the PDB.

								During the competition, I plotted the given target coordinates into Mission Planner and EEVI had a successful autonomous takeoff. The drone began flying towards the target and it was very stable during its flight.
								 Unfortunately, gps terrain data was not properly implemented and EEVI collided with a tall hill that was between the ground station and the target. In hindsight, I should have plotted a path around the hill 
								 so I wouldn't have to rely on gps elevation data, but nevertheless I was very pleased with how the drone performed. THe autonomous flight was stable, the video feed was very stable and high quality, with only around 
								 a half second of latency, and even after the crash, the only damage sustained was to the 3D printed motor mounts, and to one leg of the landing gear. All electronics were fully intact, and we were still receiving
								  video and telemtery data after the crash. Looking forward, I want to include more distance sensor integration and rework the frame design so its lighter and easier to access.

							<p>I'm part of the RoboNav team of RoboJackets, a competetive robotics organization at Georgia Tech. 
								We competed at the annual Univeristy Rover Challenge in Utah where our rover, Walli, along with the drone, Eevi, operated in
							simulated martian conditions to complete a series of tasks such as a science mission and an equipment servicing mission.
							The rover was the main priority for the team, and as such, the drone subteam consisted only of me and one other member. 
						We were given parts from a drone that was broken and experimented with by old members and we set out to make a drone capable of assisting the rover.

								The heart of our drone was a Pixhawk flight controller running Ardupilot, something I was familiar with from previous
								 projects. We made a classic quadcopter which allowed us to use well-developed Ardupilot PID profiles for the automatic 
								 stabilization. With the main drone hardware built out, we were faced with cost constraints and were forced to use less-than-ideal 
								 camera and telemetry hardware, which would present issues later on. Additionally, we wanted to integrate an end effector on the bottom 
								 of the frame that would allow us to pick up and transport some hand-tools, allowing the rover to focus on the larger tasks.
								 While my teammate made the mechanical design for the end effector, I handled the electrical and software integration into the drone 
								 architecture. We ran into some issues supplying the necessary voltage from the Pixhawk to the end effector servos, which I decided to bypass 
								 by using a custom PCB I designed for a different project that used a seperate microcontroller to supply power and PWM to the servos.

								Shortly before competition, we realized the range of our telemetry and analog radios were more limited than we initially thought.
								 As a result, I decided that the best way to proceed would be to mount the telemetry and analog reciever on the rover itself, and relay 
								 the incoming data through its more reliable communication hardware. In this setup, the range of the drone would be localized to the 
								 operational location of the rover itself, which was much better than being tethered to the base station. Unfortunately, at competition we 
								 encountered a faulty wire connection, which prevented us from receiving video and thus from using the drone for the delivery task. 
								 We were definitely disappointed that we couldn't compete the way we wanted, but we were still proud of the work we were able to complete, 
								 and everything we learned along the way. We have a great plan going forward for version 2, and are excited to return to URC next year.
