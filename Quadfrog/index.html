							<p>This project is my hands-on exploration of drones and their capabilites. 
							I wanted to grow my skills in many different areas by developing as many components of the drone myself.
							As such, I designed and fabricated the frame of the drone, choosing a V-tail configuration to account for 
							the position of my battery. I selected and soldered the main drone electronics, as well as built my own ground station 
							module compatible with my laptop. Finally, I wrote Python and C++ programs to run on the on-board Raspberry Pi flight 
							computer as well as ground control programs for my laptop and accompanying GCS hardware. I was glad to apply experience 
							from my previous VIP as well as lessons from classes such as Statics. I was able to grow several skills as well as learn a few 
							more over the course of this project, and the drone itself will serve as a test-bed for any flying project I want to develop.
