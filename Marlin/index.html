							<p>This was the final project for AE 3030, an aerodynamics course at Georgia Tech. 
								We were offered a choice of project, to either write code to simulate some aerodynamic theory, 
								present some research on an aerodynamic topic, or build something to demonstrate aerodynamic theory.
							I decided on the latter, and the plan was to build an rc plane capable of interchanging wings in order
						 to demonstrate different airfoils and their effects. </p>

						 <p>
							Over time the project developed and I decided to split it into two seperate products: one fully 
							functional RC plane, and a smaller glider with interchanging wings. Marlin and Nemo. For the RC plane, 
							I used and Arduino Nano connected to an HC-12 radio embedded onto a custom designed and milled PCB 
							for the flight controls. I leveraged the ground control hardware and code I made for my QuadFrog project and adapted 
							it for control of a plane. This also meant that I needed to write additional code for the Arduino since the 
							QuadFrog remote code was meant for use on a Raspberry Pi 4.

						 <p>
							For the short timeframe of the project, I was pretty happy with the results:
							 an aerodynamically functional glider, able to demonstrate various airfoils, including
							 some fun aerodynamic phenomenon such as the roll that occurs when you mount a wing upsidedown on one side.
							 The RC plane for the most part worked as intended, with steady communications between the Nano and my laptop 
							 and functional ailerons and throttle control. I plan to continue to develop this project, as I feel that
							  the circuit and code I wrote can be easily implemented in a variety of plane designs.
